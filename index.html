            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Carla Centurion</strong>. I'm from <strong>Buenos Aires, Argentina.</strong> A little bit about myself...</p>
            <p>...     .... </p>
            <p>.    ... </p>
            <p> I'm a mother of two teenagers. One of them started seminary this year so we are getting up early everyday. On the weekends they both play instruments so they have orquesta practice. </p>
            <p>I'm an English teacher! I teach high school students. I love to see my students learn and progress. </p>
            <p>I enjoy reading and watching movies and series. I like to watch the same movie several times and pay attention to diferent points of view or different characters or settings.</p>
            <p>I love playing sports. Specially soccer and handball. I also like to play games</p>
            <p>On my free time I like to spend time with my family. We love to travel but sometimes is hard to find time and money.</p>
            <p>My favorite place to visit is Cordoba. --Cordoba is a Province in Argentina. The landscape is beautiful. you can see mountains, rivers, lakes, waterfall and much more. The weather is dry, which is perfect if you live in a place like Buenos Aires that is very humid.</p>
            <p>I serve as stake primary secretary. I prefer teaching callings but I serve where the lord sends me.</p>
